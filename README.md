# taste_task
this is just about everything you will need to run a tampico experiment,
most of this is based off the work of Stice and Burger but Poldrack and I 
have made changes.

The meaty code part is:
liquid2.py

Make sure exputils.py, tampico and water jpegs, and psychtask are all in the same
folder.

There are drivers that need to be installed and unfortunately you just
have to google them.

You will need the psychtask tool box which can be found here:

github.com/poldrack/pytask

The python code requires PsychoPy2. The best way to get this is downloading
the gui from here:

http://www.psychopy.org/

Then run the task through the gui's commandline. It isn't ideal, but it works.

Photos of all the pump stuff is in the folder named pumpstuff.

The sugar brain lab notebook powerpoint details how I set up the gustometer to
prevent bubbles.
